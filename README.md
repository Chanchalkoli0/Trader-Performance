Through this project I made Trader Behavior Insights Report :-
1. Introduction
This report provides a simple overview of trader behavior using basic analysis steps.
It includes data loading, structure checking, and preparation for further analysis.
2. Data Loading
In this step, the dataset is loaded using Python's pandas library.
This helps in accessing the data and preparing it for analysis.
3. Basic Data Overview
I examine the first few rows, shape, and structure of the dataset to understand
its contents and identify any missing values or inconsistencies.
4. Conclusion
The initial steps performed here prepare the dataset for deeper analysis such as
visualization, feature exploration, and modeling in future stages.
